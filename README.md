# Data Warehouse Build in Snowflake (Data Engineering)

## 📌 Objective
Develop a modern cloud-based data warehouse using **Snowflake** to consolidate sales data from multiple systems, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

---

## 🏗️ Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **modern Medallion-style architecture** (Bronze → Silver → Gold layers) in Snowflake for sales analytics.

- **Bronze Layer** → Raw ingestion of ERP and CRM source data.  
- **Silver Layer** → Cleaned, standardized, and integrated datasets.  
- **Gold Layer** → Business-ready data models optimized for BI and analytics.  

---

## 🔑 Specifications

### Data Sources
- **ERP System** – Transactions, product master data, etc.  
- **CRM System** – Customer information, interactions, and sales pipeline.  

### Data Quality
- Identify and resolve duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent keys.  
- Apply business rules to ensure reliable analytics.  

### Integration
- Combine ERP and CRM datasets into a single, user-friendly **star schema** or **dimensional model**.  

### Scope
- Current data only (no historization).  
- Focus on **analytical querying** and **business intelligence enablement**.  

### Documentation
- Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both **business stakeholders** and **analytics teams**.

## 📊 BI & Analytics Objectives
Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver insights into:

- **Customer Behavior** → Segmentation, retention, churn risk.  
- **Product Performance** → Top/bottom performers, profitability analysis.  
- **Sales Trends** → Seasonality, regional patterns, growth tracking.  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Snowflake** – Cloud data warehouse.  
- **dbt (optional)** – Data transformations and modeling.  
- **Fivetran / Airbyte (optional)** – Data ingestion from ERP & CRM.  
- **Tableau / Power BI (optional)** – Visualization & dashboards.  
- **GitHub Actions (optional)** – CI/CD for SQL and dbt models.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
2. **Create Snowflake environment (Warehouse, Database, Schemas: bronze, silver, gold).**
3. **Load source data into the Bronze layer.**
4. **Apply transformations using SQL/dbt to create Silver and Gold layers.**
5. **Run analytics queries from the Gold layer.**
